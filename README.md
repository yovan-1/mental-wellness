Explanation to the code i added for QGM in the GoalSetting.php
 Concept: Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) Approach
The Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) model is used to define, evaluate, and measure the effectiveness of mental health goals within the Mental Wellness Monitoring and Self-Care Recommendation System.

 How GQM is Implemented in the System
 Goal

Users set a mental health goal, such as "Reduce stress" or "Improve sleep habits".
A timeline is assigned (e.g., 1 week, 1 month, 3 months).
 Question

The system asks: “Is the user making progress toward their goal?”
This is answered through mood tracking trends, self-assessments, and user feedback.
Metric

Mood Scores: Tracking mood changes over time.
Goal Completion Status: Whether the user met their goal within the set timeline.
User Engagement: How often users interact with the system to update their progress.
